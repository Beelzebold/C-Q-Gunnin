helptitles[8]="WINNING & SCORING"

helppages[8]="winning is a pretty\nimportant part of any\ngame, and this is no\nexception. you win by\nsimply eliminating all\nopposing pieces.\n \nyour final score is based\non the number of turns it\ntook to complete the map,\nhow much damage your\ntroops sustained, and how\nmuch damage you  dished\nout across the mission."

helptitles[9]="PIECE LEVELS"

helppages[9]="as a piece nets more\nkills, it will gain\nLEVELS. the piece's LEVEL\n(denoted as L on the stat\nbar) affects its DMG and\nAP. progress toward the\nnext LEVEL is shown next\nto L on the stat bar.\n \nwhen a support piece gains\nLEVEL, it gains only an\nHP refill of 10."
