# C-Q-Gunnin
Small NES-stylized topdown gridbased turnbased strategy game with lots of close quarters gunnin'.

Hello proud and esteemed Commanding Officer! This readme is dedicated to giving you a quick brush up on basic usage of your Nintendo Entertainment System Military Control Deck. For game and strategy help, see the HELP section ingame.

-- Control Deck Buttons (And Corresponding Keybindings) --

When prompted to press button A or B on your Control Deck, the corresponding keys on a keyboard are Z and X. The corresponding key for the Control Deck button START is Enter. These are labelled as such to resemble the familiar controls of the Nintendo Entertainment System Military Control Deck, while using a keyboard binding familiar to many fans of military strategy "Video Games." The Directional Pad on the Control Deck corresponds to the Arrow keys on a keyboard.

This concludes the summary of keyboard controls.

-- Menu Navigation --

Navigating the option menus involves use of the Control Deck's Directional Pad to select a menu option, and pressing the button A to confirm your selection.
While in Battle, pressing the button START will open the quick menu, from which you can end your turn, see the HELP screens, and retreat, should you deem a victory impossible. The HELP screen should be able to teach you anything you would need to know about controlling and positioning your pieces in a Battle.
If for whatever reason you wish to exit our lovely quick menus, you can either press button START again or button B.

This concludes the summary of navigating the menus.
And as such, concludes the explanations within the scope of this readme. Now go spill some blood, Commander! I wish you good luck!
