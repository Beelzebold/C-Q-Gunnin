Hello proud and esteemed Commanding Officer! This readme is dedicated to giving you a quick brush up on basic usage of your Nintendo Entertainment System Military Control Deck. For game and strategy help, see the HELP section ingame.


-- Control Deck Buttons (And Corresponding Keybindings) --

When prompted to press button A or B on your Control Deck, the corresponding keys on a keyboard are Z (or Mouse 1) and X (sometimes Escape). The corresponding key for the Control Deck button START is Enter (or Escape for pausing). These are labelled as such to resemble the familiar controls of the Nintendo Entertainment System Military Control Deck, while using a keyboard binding familiar to many fans of military strategy "Video Games." The Directional Pad on the Control Deck corresponds to the Arrow keys on a keyboard.

This concludes the summary of keyboard controls.


-- Menu Navigation --

Navigating the option menus involves use of the Control Deck's Directional Pad to select a menu option, and pressing the button A to confirm your selection (or simply clicking on an option). While in Battle, pressing the button START will open the quick menu, from which you can end your turn, see the HELP screens, and retreat, should you deem a victory impossible. The HELP screen should be able to teach you anything you would need to know about controlling and positioning your pieces in a Battle. If for whatever reason you wish to exit our lovely quick menus, you can either press button START again or button B.

This concludes the summary of navigating the menus. And as such, concludes the explanations within the scope of this readme. Now go spill some blood, Commander! I wish you good luck!







## C-Q-Gunnin' Map Editor ##

Hello and welcome, new and future legendary level designer! This readme is dedicated to teaching you how to make small levels for C-Q-Gunnin'. Unfortunately, as of this time, multi screen custom levels are not supported without source code modification!


-- Basic Controls --

The level editor does not currently support these new "computer mouse" thingamajigs yet, and as such is navigated with the Arrow keys, Enter, and the keys Z, X, A, and S.

To begin, you are loaded into MAP1 of C-Q-Gunnin', Courtyard. Move your cursor with the Arrow keys on your keyboard, press the Z key to place something, and press the X key to cycle what object to place. You can press the A key to toggle between TILE and PIECE mode, and while in PIECE mode you can press the S key to toggle what team the piece you're placing will be. Also while in PIECE mode, you can press the Delete key to remove a piece from the level.


-- Menus & Settings --

Pressing the Enter key will open the menu, from which you can save your level (which will be output to %appdata%/nikowa_cqgunnin on Windows or XDG_DATA_HOME/love/nikowa_cqgunnin on Linux) or clear it with the selected tile type, or open the level settings menu. this menu contains your level's NAME and PAR SCORE, so be sure to set these before saving!

You can load a previously saved level into either the editor itself or C-Q-Gunnin' by dragging and dropping the file over the window from your file explorer.

This concludes the summary of using the map editor. Have fun!
